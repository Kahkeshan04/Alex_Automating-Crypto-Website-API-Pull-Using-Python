# Crypto Data Analysis with CoinMarketCap API

## Overview

This project aims to explore cryptocurrency data using the CoinMarketCap API along with Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, we seek to gain insights into cryptocurrency market trends and behavior.

## Key Insights and Learnings

### 1. Data Retrieval

#### CoinMarketCap API Integration
- Utilized the CoinMarketCap API to access real-time data on cryptocurrency listings.
- Incorporated the `requests` library in Python to handle HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

#### Customized API Queries
- Explored various parameters such as `start`, `limit`, and `convert` to tailor API queries based on specific requirements.
- Adjusted query parameters to retrieve data for different cryptocurrencies, time periods, and currency conversions.

#### Error Handling
- Implemented error handling mechanisms to manage potential issues such as connection errors, timeouts, and too many redirects.
- Utilized try-except blocks to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative error messages.

### 2. Data Processing and Analysis

#### Pandas Data Manipulation
- Processed the retrieved data using Pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python.
- Employed Pandas functions to transform raw API responses into structured DataFrame objects for analysis.

#### Data Normalization
- Utilized the `pd.json_normalize()` function to handle nested JSON structures returned by the CoinMarketCap API.
- Normalized data into a tabular format, facilitating efficient analysis and visualization.

#### Descriptive Statistics
- Calculated descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles to summarize cryptocurrency price distributions.
- Leveraged Pandas' statistical functions to gain insights into the central tendency and variability of cryptocurrency prices.

### 3. Data Visualization

#### Matplotlib and Seaborn Visualization
- Leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn, popular data visualization libraries in Python, to create insightful visualizations.
- Utilized line plots to visualize cryptocurrency prices over time, facilitating trend analysis and pattern identification.
- Employed point plots to analyze percentage changes in cryptocurrency prices across different time intervals (e.g., 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days).

#### Plot Customization
- Customized plot styles, colors, labels, and axes to enhance visualization clarity and aesthetics.
- Applied visual enhancements such as grid lines, legends, and annotations to convey additional information effectively.

### 4. Automation

#### Script Development
- Developed a Python script (`api_runner.py`) to automate data retrieval from the CoinMarketCap API.
- Implemented logic to fetch cryptocurrency data at regular intervals and store it in CSV format for further analysis.

#### Task Scheduling
- Scheduled the execution of the `api_runner.py` script using cron jobs or task scheduler utilities.
- Configured scheduled tasks to run periodically, ensuring that the dataset remains up-to-date with the latest cryptocurrency information.

#### Optimization Strategies
- Explored optimization strategies to improve data retrieval and processing efficiency.
- Considered techniques such as caching, parallel processing, and batch requests to minimize API latency and maximize throughput.
